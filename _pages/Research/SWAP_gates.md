## Low Frequency (b)SWAP gates in superconducting circuits

This is a joint project with a Masters sutdent in Erlangen. We are examining the properties of capacitively coupled superconducting circuits without applying perturbative techniques to the parametric drive. This has revealed it is possible to drive the system at lower frequencies then previously thought. We have used this thinking to implmenet bSWAP gates which are related to SWAP gates via single qubit interactions. If we suceed we could provide an alternative way to produce SWAP gates in driven circuit. Previously they have been decomposed into three two qubit gates, reducing this circuit overhead is always a plus in quantum computing.
