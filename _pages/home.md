Hello, welcome to my website. 
<br>
<br>
I am a Physics PhD student studying Superconducting Circuits at Heriot Watt Univeristy. This website is partly a portfolio of all my research, comments on the research and a blog. Mainly this will be my blog that I use as an excuse to get stuck into some fun maths and programming concepts.
<br>
<br>
I will usually stick to posting about academic things but I also have other interests including baking, cycling and random projects that I come up with. These other projects will often be excuses to play around wtih new things like video/photo editing. But anyway hope you enjoy looking around here.
