Currently I am working with Quantum Superconducting Circuits to develop Multi-Body interactions within these circuits. These interactions will imporve the current multi body Quantum Gates by performing them in a single interaction.
<br>
I also work with some theoritical condensed matter looking into the links between Chern Simons theory  and the franctional quantum hall effect. 
<br> 
My work with supercondcuting circuits has given me an interest in quantum computing that has exapnded my interests in Quanutm Computing to Quantum Simulators and Quantum Machine Learning. Both of which I am researching in my PhD.

				Many body interactions within supercondcuting circuits are usually broken down into one and two qubit gates. This slows down the interaction and reduces the overall fidelity of the gate. I aim to imporve this by designing a circuit that can perform three body interactions.
